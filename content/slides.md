title: 00 / prologue
subtitle: 2025 wasn't just a year in the ai calendar.
visual: breath
layout: split

it was the moment **context became the most expensive resource on earth**.

we called this report the context gap because it identifies the primary fracture in modern civilization: the distance between the volume of data a machine can generate and the amount of meaning a human can integrate without losing their agency, their sanity, or their will.

**machines have conquered the complexity barrier.**

**humans have hit the context wall.**

ai is accelerating. humans are buffering.

---
title: 01 / the battle for agency
subtitle: why are we doing this?
visual: network
layout: split

we are solving a fundamental crisis: **the loss of agency**.

in a world where generating content, code, and ideas is effectively free, the act of verifying them has become a luxury. we are currently paying a **reliability tax** with our time and attention.

if you cannot audit what the algorithm proposes, you are no longer a leader—you are a passenger.



this report is your perimeter defense against:

**context obesity:** cognitive paralysis where you are stuffed with low-value data but starved for meaning. burnout is working memory overflow.

**the reliability tax:** $67 billion in annual losses. creating is free; verifying is expensive.

**the responsibility void:** decisions being made by agents for whose mistakes no human is held accountable.

**data inbreeding:** if ai trains on ai-generated data recursively, models degrade. humans become the only source of clean signal.

title: 02 / the 11 shifts architecture
subtitle: a paired map in 4 layers.
visual: hierarchy
layout: split

**🧱 foundation layer (3):** energy, work, sovereignty — the physical and economic base

**🧠 cognition layer (3):** reasoning, knowledge, discovery — how we think and learn

**🛡️ interface layer (3):** coding, matter, defense — how we build and protect

**❤️ humanity layer (2):** narrative, intimacy — what keeps us human



this is: **machine signal** (capability / deployment / economics) ↔ **human signal** (cognition / identity / culture) ↔ **the context gap** (where coordination breaks)

this isn't: a hype deck, a moral panic, or a consulting pdf that says nothing new.

---
title: shift 01: the cost → physical limits
subtitle: physics takes revenge. the constraint for 2026 isn't chips; it's "intelligence per watt."
visual: battery
layout: loop

**Machine:** **the energy wall:** ai demand for data center power projected to grow **160% by 2030**. the physical grid cannot be built fast enough to support ai expansion.

**intelligence/watt:** the focus shifts from raw compute to "inference efficiency" as the critical metric. more compute doesn't equal more value if it can't be powered.

**$7 trillion** event: big tech capex for 2025 alone is **$200b+**. the **40x investment-value gap**: $600b needed in annual revenue to justify infrastructure spend, but consumer spend is only $12b.

**Human:** **guilt computing:** users face the reality that complex reasoning has a physical toll — every ai query consumes water and generates co2. the disconnect between "green ai" corporate promises and "greed ai" reality.

**hardware sovereignty:** shift to on-device ai to decouple from cloud latency, costs, and energy volatility. privacy becomes a side benefit; energy independence is the driver.

**Gap:** the disconnect between infinite "digital ideas" and hard "physical matter." while we imagine a billion agents, we cannot power them. this is the bottleneck of "the dream."

---

loopNumber: 1

**Key Stats:**
- **160%:** AI energy demand surge by 2030 (IEA / Goldman Sachs)
- **40x:** Gap: $500B infrastructure vs $12B consumer spend (Harvard / Goldman)
- **$7T:** Total AI infrastructure requirement (McKinsey / Sam Altman)

title: how this enables the next shift
subtitle: when infrastructure exists, labor displacement accelerates.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

with energy infrastructure in place, ai moves from research labs to **production deployment**.



the constraint was power. now the constraint is **human acceptance**.

agentic labor becomes real.

---
title: shift 02: the displacement (agentic labor)
subtitle: the death of middle management.
visual: factory
layout: loop

**Machine:** **the klarna benchmark:** one ai assistant replaced **700 full-time agents**, slashed resolution time (11m → 2m), drove **$40m profit**, and achieved **25% fewer repeat inquiries** than humans.

**the agentic enterprise:** transition from "assistant" to "autonomous coworker." **76% of executives** view ai as a "coworker" rather than a tool. agents receive wallets (x402 protocol), tools (mcp), and "hr for ai."

**service-as-software:** saas model shifts to agents that execute complete workflows. from selling "software licenses" to selling "executed outcomes."

**Human:** **the reliability tax:** **$67 billion** in losses from ai hallucinations and errors. companies shift budgets from "paying for labor" to "paying for audit." creating is free; verifying is expensive.

**managerial collapse:** predicted **45% reduction in middle management layers** as ai handles coordination. the tension between "retrofit" vs "reengineer."

**role shift:** humans move from "doers" to "consiglieres" and auditors. **23.2 million** u.s. jobs directly exposed to ai displacement.

**Gap:** when an agent acts, who owns the mistake? managers delegate more than they can audit, creating hidden "technical debt" and "strategic blindness."

---
title: the displacement: the evidence
visual: factory
layout: loop-evidence
loopNumber: 2

**Key Stats:**
- **88% vs 6%:** Adoption rate vs transformation rate - execution gap (McKinsey)
- **23.2M:** U.S. jobs highly exposed to displacement (SHRM)
- **$40M:** Annual profit from single agentic deployment (Klarna) (Klarna)

---
title: how this enables the next shift
subtitle: when agents touch money, institutions demand rules.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

when agentic labor becomes real and **impacts revenue**, nations and corporations rush to control the infrastructure.



the question shifts from "can ai work?" to **"whose switch is it?"**

sovereignty becomes the battleground.

---
title: shift 03: the sovereignty (the splinternet)
subtitle: from global openness → fragmented stacks
visual: globe
layout: loop-intro


---
title: shift 03: the sovereignty (the splinternet)
subtitle: whose switch is it?
visual: globe
layout: loop

**Machine:** **geopolitical fragmentation - the splinternet:** the end of "global ai." three distinct stacks emerge: **us ai** (corporate/closed - openai, anthropic), **china ai** (state-controlled - deepseek bypassing us norms), **eu ai** (regulated - ai act compliance). agi is now a national security asset on "war footing."

**the copyright war - nyt vs. openai:** battle for "sovereignty of culture." nyt lawsuit alleges models **memorize and regurgitate** copyrighted content verbatim. the case determines if human culture belongs to creators or model weights.

**eu ai act:** first comprehensive ai regulation. creates **regulatory gap** - eu ai is "safe but slow," us/china ai is "dangerous but fast."

**Human:** **the guerrilla stack (byoai):** employees bring their own ai to bypass corporate limitations and censorship. "shadow ai" adoption - people use personal tools because corporate ai is blocked or neutered.

**privacy inequality:** privacy officially becomes a **luxury good**. meta's "pay or consent" model in eu: pay €13/month or surrender to tracking. "privacy is for the rich" - if you can't pay, you are the product.

**data sovereignty movement:** users demand "opt-out" rights - ability to prohibit training on their data. rise of "personal rag" and local-first architectures.

**Gap:** as ai becomes "aligned" to corporate/national values, you are talking to a constitutional filter. you lose objective context for a "safe narrative."

---

loopNumber: 3

**Key Stats:**
- **3%:** Paying users for AI (97% are the product) (Goldman Sachs)
- **€13/mo:** Meta's privacy price in Europe (Wired)
- **3 Stacks:** US (closed), China (state), EU (regulated) - global AI fragmentation (Multiple)

title: layer transition: foundation → cognition
subtitle: when infrastructure exists, intelligence accelerates.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

with **energy infrastructure**, **agentic labor**, and **geopolitical stacks** in place, ai moves from raw compute to **reasoning capability**.



the question shifts from "can we power it?" to **"can we trust how it thinks?"**

cognition becomes the new frontier.

---
title: shift 04: the reasoning (the brain)
subtitle: from chatbots to thinking models
visual: audit
layout: loop-intro


---
title: shift 04: the reasoning (the brain)
subtitle: from probabilistic prediction → inference-time logic (system 2 thinking)
visual: audit
layout: loop

**Machine:** **sequoia's act two:** the fundamental shift from "act 1" (probabilistic token prediction - chatgpt era) to **"act 2"** (reasoning and inference-time compute - o1 era). "act 1 was about prompts. act 2 is about reasoning."

**system 1 vs system 2 architecture:** transition from fast, instinctive responses (system 1) to slow, deliberate, multi-step logical reasoning (system 2). models use **chain of thought (cot)** and **star** via reinforcement learning to "think" before answering.

**scientific compression:** condensing **100 years of scientific progress into 10 years**. prediction: models will exceed nobel-level intelligence in specialized domains (biology, math, physics) by 2026.

**Human:** **auditable work:** users no longer trust "magic" speed. they demand to see the **reasoning trace** - the chain of thought that led to the conclusion. transparency over velocity.

**logic auditor role:** human value shifts from execution to **verifying machine logic**. we become auditors of ai reasoning paths.

**the reasoning reliability gap:** **48% of reasoning tasks** still produce errors in complex scenarios. reasoning models haven't eliminated hallucinations - they've made them more convincing.

**Gap:** a model processes 1,000 reasoning steps in seconds; a human follows five. this leads to meaning dilution: we accept conclusions because auditing the path is too exhausting.

title: the reasoning: the evidence
visual: audit
layout: loop-evidence
loopNumber: 4

**Key Stats:**
- **126%:** Productivity boost from AI Copilots (Qodo)
- **21%:** Quality degradation when prioritizing speed (Nielsen Norman Group)
- **48%:** Error rate in complex reasoning tasks (Korra AI)

---
title: how this enables the next shift
subtitle: when ai can think, it needs context.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

reasoning without context is blind logic.



system 2 thinking creates demand for **massive context windows** and **enterprise knowledge integration**.

the question shifts from "can it reason?" to **"can it access the right information?"**

---
title: shift 05: the knowledge (the memory)
subtitle: from information hoarding to context filtering
visual: tangle
layout: loop-intro


---
title: shift 05: the knowledge (the memory)
subtitle: from information access → context architecture
visual: tangle
layout: loop

**Machine:** **model context protocol (mcp):** anthropic's "usb port for ai" - universal standard for connecting ai to data ecosystems (google drive, slack, git) without custom integrations. this is the infrastructure answer to data silos.

**the hallucination tax:** **$67 billion** in enterprise losses from context mismanagement and ai errors. the shift from "paying for ai" to "paying to fix ai mistakes."

**1m token windows:** models can now hold massive context, but retrieval quality degrades beyond human working memory limits (7 items).

**Human:** **context obesity (the diagnosis):** "you're not burned out, you have context obesity." a cognitive state caused by overconsumption of low-value data. burnout is **working memory overflow** - consuming more information than can be metabolized into meaning.

**context collapse (marwick & boyd):** the academic term for when personal, professional, and public contexts blur into one. ai radicalizes this - agents extract your words from context and feed them to models.

**search waste:** employees spend **30% of work time** searching for internal information. knowledge access isn't the problem - knowledge **discovery** and **curation** are.

**Gap:** 1m token windows vs. human limit (7 items). we have tmi (too much information) but zero insight. context collapse blurs professional and private life.

---
title: the knowledge: the evidence
visual: tangle
layout: loop-evidence
loopNumber: 5

**Key Stats:**
- **$67B:** Annual financial risk from unmanaged context/hallucinations (Korra AI)
- **30%:** Work time lost to internal search (Gartner)
- **1M tokens:** Model context window vs 7 items human working memory limit (Anthropic)

---
title: how this enables the next shift
subtitle: when ai has context, it can generate knowledge.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

with reasoning capability and massive context integration, ai moves from **reading science to generating science**.



the bottleneck shifts from computation to **verification**.

discovery bloat: ai proposes 1,000 molecules; we test one.

---
title: shift 06: the discovery (the frontier)
subtitle: from reading science → generating science
visual: spark
layout: loop-intro


---
title: shift 06: the discovery (the frontier)
subtitle: from literature review to generative discovery
visual: spark
layout: loop

**Machine:** **deep research agents:** ai reads millions of papers to generate hypotheses humans cannot conceive. from "literature review" to "hypothesis generation."

**generative biology:** moving from "reading" biology to "writing" it. alphafold 3 predicts protein structures; next step is **designing** new proteins, materials, and molecules that don't exist in nature.

**data limits - the exhaustion:** quality human-generated data **exhausted by 2026-2028**. models now train on **ai-generated synthetic data**, verified by system 2 reasoning.

**Human:** **the time refund:** scientists freed from tedious manual labor (literature review, data cleaning) to focus on high-level experimental design and cross-domain synthesis.

**data inbreeding crisis:** without fresh human data, ai degrades. **humans become the only source of novelty** - the "organic data" that prevents model collapse. human creativity is now a strategic resource.

**the hope/fear axis:** hope for longevity breakthroughs and disease cures vs fear of losing control over scientific truth and safety protocols.

**Gap:** ai proposes 1,000 molecules; we test one. discovery bloat stalls breakthroughs via physical testing capacity. the bottleneck of "generated future."

---
title: the discovery: the evidence

loopNumber: 6

**Key Stats:**
- **100 → 10:** Scientific progress compression timeline (years) (Dario Amodei)
- **78%:** Improvement in research speed with AI tools (StackOverflow)
- **2026-2028:** Human data exhaustion timeline (Epoch AI)

---
title: layer transition: cognition → interface
subtitle: when ai can think and discover, it starts to build.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

with reasoning, knowledge access, and discovery capabilities, ai moves from **abstract intelligence to practical execution**.



the question shifts from "can it think?" to **"can it ship?"**

interface becomes the battleground.

visual: centaur
layout: loop-intro


---
title: shift 07: the craft (the end of syntax)
subtitle: from syntax mastery → vibe coding (and the integrity crisis)
visual: centaur
layout: loop

**Machine:** **code as commodity:** **65% of new code** is ai-influenced or ai-generated at companies like google. **73% of developers** use ai coding tools regularly.

**amazon q developer:** saved **4,500 developer-years** on java application upgrades. **$260m** in infrastructure savings from optimized code. **79% of auto-generated changes** accepted without modification.

**vibe coding:** programming shifts to natural language intent. the machine handles implementation. coding tools (cursor, replit) enter **top 100 gen ai apps** consumer ranking - coding becomes mass-market.

**Human:** **the trust collapse:** **46% of developers** distrust ai-generated code. only **3.1% highly trust** ai accuracy for complex tasks. the **trust inversion**: 84% use the tools, but trust is plummeting.

**the integrity crisis:** **65% report ai misses context** in code generation. "code generation is easy, code integrity is hard." ai creates "legacy on day one" - code that works but is unmaintainable.

**code churn explosion:** **50% increase** in code churn (rewrites and deletions). ai produces code fast, but developers spend saved time on reviews and fixes.

**Gap:** building things we don't understand leads to vibe debt. we pilot ships with black-box internal wiring. creating code is easy; maintaining it is the new hell.

---
title: shift 08: on-device models ↔ privacy as status
subtitle: smaller models get good enough and spread everywhere.
visual: unlocked
layout: loop

**Machine:** ai becomes ambient — less a destination, more a layer.
on devices, at the edge, inside apps. smaller models get good enough.

**Human:** privacy becomes status. not secrecy — **control**.
more private drafting, smaller circles, local storage, intentional friction against performative posting.

**Gap:** when ai is everywhere, boundaries become the differentiator.
**if everything can be processed, the premium shifts to what you keep.**

---
title: privacy: the evidence

**Key Stats:**
- **30%:** Chinese open-source LLM global share (from 1.2%) (ChinaTalk 2025)
- **90-95%:** DeepSeek cost reduction vs OpenAI o1 (DeepSeek 2025)
- **10M+:** Qwen app downloads in one week (Alibaba 2025)

---
title: how this enables the next shift
subtitle: when AI is everywhere, relationships become possible.
visual: bridge
layout: center
dark: true

as models move on-device (ambient, always available, private), the relationship changes from **tool to companion**.



constant access + privacy + personalization = conditions for **emotional adoption**.



not just "useful," but "trusted."

title: shift 09: machine intimacy + programmable identity
subtitle: ai moves from tool to relationship surface.
visual: echo
layout: loop

**Machine:** companions, therapists, griefbots, parasocial loops.
in parallel, ai makes it easy to produce a "professional self" at scale — identity becomes programmable.

**Human:** loneliness isn't solved by information.
people accept synthetic intimacy (even while knowing it's synthetic).
meanwhile, people tire of performing the self; they retreat to private spaces and smaller audiences.

**Gap:** humans outsource emotional regulation to systems optimized for engagement.
**we confuse "attention" with "care."**

visual: barrier
layout: loop

**Machine:** training leans harder on synthetic data and distillation.
as synthetic output floods the environment, "evidence" becomes a formatting problem: it can look right before it is right.

**Human:** trust becomes scarce.
people shift from "is it true?" to "is it traceable?"
the new literacy is **provenance**.

**Gap:** machines can manufacture infinite text and images.
humans can't manufacture infinite meaning.
**the ratio collapses.**

**Machine:** chips, energy, cooling, geopolitics.
even digital gods need electricity.
energy and compute become the regulator of progress.

**Human:** energy economics turns personal: burnout realism, fatigue, "time hangover," sharper awareness of biological limits.
people begin optimizing for sustainability, not maximum output.

**Gap:** data centres become local political issues; your "cloud" starts to feel like a land dispute.
philosophical note: thermodynamics returns as a hidden governor — you can't out-optimize scarcity forever.
